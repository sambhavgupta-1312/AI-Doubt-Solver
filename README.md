# ðŸ¤– AI Doubt SolverðŸ’¡

Preparing for interviews can be a daunting task, especially for college students navigating a competitive job market. With diverse topics to cover, ranging from technical subjects to behavioral questions, having a reliable and efficient system
to streamline preparation becomes essential.
To address this challenge, our project is designed as an intelligent interview preparation tool tailored for college students.
The primary objective of this project is to provide instant and accurate answers to questions posed by the user, enhancing their preparation process. Students can either enter specific questions or broader topics, and the system dynamically fetches contextually relevant answers.

By leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combined with vectorization techniques, the project ensures the answers are not only precise but also contextually aligned with the user's input.
At the heart of the system lies the integration of a well-curated knowledge base, referred to as "the book," which serves as the primary source of information.

This book comprises a comprehensive collection of material covering technical, analytical, and conceptual topics crucial for interviews. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project efficiently vectorizes the content within the book, enabling quick retrieval and generation of responses tailored to the query or topic entered by the user.

The RAG pipeline enhances this process by merging the capabilities of retrieval systems and generative models. Upon receiving a query, the pipeline identifies the most relevant segments from the book using vector search and subsequently refines the content using generative AI techniques to provide a human-like and refined response. This ensures the user receives high-quality answers without the need to sift through lengthy documents or multiple resources.

Our project is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling students to focus on learning and building confidence for their interviews. By simplifying the preparation process, this tool empowers users with quick access to curated knowledge, ultimately bridging the gap between theoretical learning and practical application in interviews.
